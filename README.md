## Things I've learned 🎓

- CSS Grid responsiveness
- Use of minmax to stablish a minimum and maximum sizes on every column
- Using grid-auto-rows to create dynamic rows plus use span on each card to reach the masonry effect

## Going further 🚀
These would be the possible next steps for this project
- Get country names, featured photos and Google Maps link from an API
